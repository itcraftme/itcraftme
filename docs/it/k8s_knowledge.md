# K8s knowledge
  Learned from youtube posted by nana  [k8s video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X48VuDVv0do)  
# Overview of k8s
  - Open source container orchastration tool
  - Developed by google
  - Helped you to manage containerized applications in different development environment (local,server,cloud or hybrid environment)
  - New trend of future development increased usage of container and it is really difficult to manage containers especially there are a lot of containers to be managed, so k8s comes up to solve this problem.
  - K8s provides 
      High availability or no downtime. 
      Scalability and high performance. 
      Disaster recovery or backup and restore. 
# K8s basic components
  - Node  (*Worker node or master node.*)
  - Pod (*Small unit of k8s, abstraction over container, usually one application per Pod, each pod get its own internal ip address.*)
  - Container (*Can die easily and each time it will get a new ip address so it is not easy to manage here service comes up to solve this problem.*)
  - Service (*Internal or external service.*)
  - Ingress (*Forward request to service.*)
  - Configmap 9*Configuration of service and others.*)
  - Secret (*Store confidential data and it just works like configmap.*)
  - Volume for data storage (*Database data or log data has to be persistent.*)
  - Replica (*Can be configured to create a replica pod.*)
  - Deployment (*All the pod or container will be created by deployment and replica will be configured within a deployment.*)
  - Stateful set (*For application like databases such as mySQL, mongo DB, elastic search etc.*)  **It is really tedious to manage a stateful set so databases normally will be hosted outside k8s**

## Master processes 
### API Server
    - Is like a cluster gateway and acts as a gatekeeper for authentication. 
### Scheduler 
    - Decides which worker node will be scheduled in an intelegient way and Kubelet in worker node will acutally schedule it.
### Controller Manager 
    - Detects state change such as pad dies and tells the schudler to notice it.
### etcd 
    - Is Key-value store for the cluster and application data is not stored here.
## Worker processes
### Kubelet 
    - Interacts with both the container and node.
### Kube Proxy
    - Will forward request from node to node and avoiding the overhead of network.
### Container runtime
    - Is runtime for the containers inside pod.
# Minikube & Kubectl
## Minikube
### What is minikube?
    One node which has both master and worker processes running and has container runtime pre-installed.
        - Creates virtual box on your labtop
        - Node runs in that virtual box
        - 1 Node k8s cluster
        - For testing purposes
### Installation of minikube
    - Install hypervisor first.
    - Install minikube and kubectl will be installed as well.
### Minikube commands
![minikube start](./images/startminikube.png)
Start a cluster: `minikube start --vm-driver=hyperkit`
    
## Kubectl
### What is kubectl?
   It is a command line tool for k8s cluster
        - CLI (kubectl) to talk to API server other than UI or API.
        - Kubectl is the tool for any cluster such as cloud cluster or hybrid cluster.
### Kubectl basic commands
  - Create a deployment: `kubectl deployment nginx-deployment --image=nginx`
  - Get replicaset: `kubectl get replicaset`
  - Get pod: `kubctl get pod`
  - Edit a deployment: `kubectl edit deployment nginx-deployment`
  - Delete a deployment: `kubectl delete deployment nginx-deployment` 
  - Get status of different k8s components: `kubectl get nodes | pod | services | replicaset | deployment`
  - Debug pods(*Log to console*): `kubectl logs [log name]`
  - Debug pods (*Get interactive terminal*): `kubectl exec -it [pod name] --bin/bash` 
  - Apply a configuration for a deployment: `kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml`
  - Basic deployment config file:
    ```yml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: nginx-deployment
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      replicas: 2
      selector:
       matchLabels:

            image: nginx:1.16
            ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
    ```
