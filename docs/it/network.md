# Knowledge of network
## ip address
- Network configuration ```ipconfig /all```
- Configuration status ```netstat -n```
## subnet mask
- A subnet mask is a 32-bit number created by setting host bits to all 0s and setting network bits to all 1s.
## default gateway
- Default gateway is the piece of hardware that sits between user's home network and the rest of the internet.
## Switch
- A network switch connects devices within a network (often a local area network, or LAN*) and forwards data packets to and from those devices.
## DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a client/server protocol that automatically provides an Internet Protocol (IP) host with its IP address and other related configuration information such as the subnet mask and default gateway.
## DNS (Domain Name Server)
- The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and distributed naming system for computers, services, and other resources in the Internet or other Internet Protocol (IP) networks.
## WINS (Windows Internet Name Service) server
- Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) is a legacy computer name registration and resolution service that maps computer NetBIOS names to IP addresses.
## NetBIOS
- NETBIOS is an application programming interface (API) that operates at the session layer (Layer 5) of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model. It provides various services, such as name service, datagram service, and session service, to facilitate communication between devices on a network.
## MAC (Media Access Control) address
- A MAC address (short for medium access control address) is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network address in communications within a network segment.
## ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
- The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a communication protocol used for discovering the link layer address, such as a MAC address, associated with a given internet layer address, typically an IPv4 address. 
- Command to query the cache ```arp -a```
## Firewall
- A Firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization's previously established security policies. At its most basic, a firewall is essentially the barrier that sits between a private internal network and the public Internet.
## Proxy
- A proxy server is a system or router that provides a gateway between users and the internet. Therefore, it helps prevent cyber attackers from entering a private network. It is a server, referred to as an “intermediary” because it goes between end-users and the web pages they visit online.
## VPN (Virtual Private Network)
- VPN describes the opportunity to establish a protected network connection when using public networks.
## Port
- In computer networking, a port or port number is a number assigned to uniquely identify a connection endpoint and to direct data to a specific service. At the software level, within an operating system, a port is a logical construct that identifies a specific process or a type of network service. A port at the software level is identified for each transport protocol and address combination by the port number assigned to it. The most common transport protocols that use port numbers are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP); those port numbers are 16-bit unsigned numbers.
## Domain
- A network domain is an administrative grouping of multiple private computer networks or local hosts within the same infrastructure.Domains can be identified using a domain name; domains which need to be accessible from the public Internet can be assigned a globally unique name within the Domain Name System (DNS).
