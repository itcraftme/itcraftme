＃ Husband's Opinions

## you ask me every day how you look and what I think, no matter what you wear whether blue.black or pink. You look at me and smile and ask me what I see.I tell you truthfully that you look beautiful always to me. Yet you often change your mind and dress a different way,then you ask again and wait for me to say. My eyes only see an angel in front of me each day so honestly what else is there left to say, but darling have a nice day...today.

＃ Wife's Thought 

## You tell me it is nice because you hope there is no second ask. You tell me I always look good because you believe there would be never next ask. You wish me a nice day because you will be playing game when I am not home. you know why I ask? because there is no conversation at all with such a boring human.
